Project Title: Data Engineering Challenge Slooze
Introduction
The goal of this project was to gather comprehensive data of products available on Alibaba, or a major e-commerce platform, and transform the raw data into meaningful insights via data cleaning and visualization techniques. This enables better understanding of product types, pricing ranges, and ratings, which are critical for market analysis and business decision-making.
Data Collection
Data was collected by scraping the Alibaba website using the web scraping tool Thunderbit. It automated the extraction of relevant product information including product names, URLs, images, prices, ratings, and geographical location from Alibaba’s publicly accessible web pages. The scraping strategy was designed to systematically navigate product listings and aggregate the necessary attributes efficiently.
Data Cleaning
The collected raw data required cleaning and preprocessing to handle inconsistencies and improve usability. Key cleaning steps included:
•	Parsing and standardizing product names to extract single, coherent product type categories.
•	Removing duplicates and irrelevant entries.
•	Converting price and rating fields to appropriate numeric formats for quantitative analysis.
•	Handling missing or incomplete data entries to ensure dataset integrity.
Data Analysis and Visualization
Post cleaning, the data was analyzed to identify the dominant laptop product types and their distribution across key attributes such as price and ratings. A count plot was created to visualize the frequency of different simplified product categories, providing an intuitive overview of the market composition. Additional visualizations can be developed to explore price trends, rating distributions, and geographic availability.
Conclusion
This project successfully scraped, cleaned, and visualized laptop product data from Alibaba, transforming raw web data into structured insights. The outcomes serve as a foundation for further exploratory analysis, competitive benchmarking, and strategic business recommendations.
